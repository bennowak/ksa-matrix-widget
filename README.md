## Problem Overview
Maintaining a list of skills for display on a professional resume, cv, or portfolio site can be a real chore. Presenting some sort of meaningful scale to potential employers is even more difficult. It's hard enough describing your skillset.  Having to produce a concise and website friendly layout that displays all this info is not a trivial task. Then throw in the need ot be able to edit that info from time to time, you have a manual task that can be mildly frustrating and time consuming. This project is an attempt to simplify that process by using a basic JSON file to house the info, then use Vanilla JS to populate a page with that info in a format that is readable, printable and exportable for use in various mediums (ie: Websites, Resumes, Dashboards, etc)

## Proposed Solution
The KSA Generator is driven primarily by a simple CSV file created by a user that is used to generate a valid JSON file for consumption by API's that can either store the ksa-profile, or for dynamic rendering on a WebSite.
