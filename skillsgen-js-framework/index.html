    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
      It's hard enough describing your skillset.  Having to produce a concise and website friendly layout that displays all this info is not a trivial task. Then throw in the need ot be able to edit that info from time to time, you have a manual task that can be frustrating. This project is an attempt to simplify that process by using a basic JSON file to house the info, then use Vanilla JS to populate a page with that info in a format that is readable, printable and exportable for use in various mediums (ie: Websites, Resumes, Dashboards, etc)
